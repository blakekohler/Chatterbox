# Chatterbox


Chatterbox is an attempt to create a chatbot that responses to voice commands. It utilizes the HTML5 Voice API to both speak and listen. Think Amazons Alexa and you basically have the right idea of what it is and what it does. 

Super easy to use and fun to play with I recommend a clone and then add some updates.
